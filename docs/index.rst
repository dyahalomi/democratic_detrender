democratic detrender
====================

Welcome to the documentation for the ``democratic detrender``!

*The documentation is currently under construction, with the API to be updated and tutorials added soon.*

Stellar time-series photometry is a combination of periodic, quasi-periodic, and non-periodic variations 
caused by both physical and instrumental factors. There is thus no "perfect" model for this nuisance signal. 
To mitigate model dependency, ``democratic detrender`` that performs stellar detrending using a novel 
ensemble-based "voting" approach via a community-of-models. This detrending package has been extensively 
tested on thousands of *TESS* and *Kepler* light curves. For more information, please see the 
`paper describing the methodology <https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09753>`_.
