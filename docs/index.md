democratic detrender
====================

Welcome to the documentation for the `democratic detrender`!

Stellar time-series photometry is a combination of periodic, quasi-periodic, and non-periodic variations caused by both physical and instrumental factors. There is thus no "perfect" model for this nuisance signal. To mitigate model dependency, `democratic detrender` that performs stellar detrending using a novel ensemble-based "voting" approach via a community-of-models. This detrending package has been extensively tested on thousands of \textit{TESS} and \textit{Kepler} light curves. For more information, please see the [paper that describes the methodology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09753).

This documentation is under active construction, and we apologize for anything confusing in the meantine.
